## Some notes on the implementation

- During our interview, I talked about Tailwind, SWR and Next.js, so I decided to use these to implement the code test. I hope you'll find it interesting :)

- I'm not really using any of the advanced Next functionality, basically just the built in page based routing.

- As for Tailwind, the long list of classes can be daunting at first, but you quickly get used to it.

- SWR certainly makes the task of using backend endpoints very simple.

- Since it's a small project with no external consumers of the components or functions created, I don't think there's a payoff in using TypeScript in this case.
